# Motivation (WIP, protoyping)
MindGrid aims to improve existing learning tools by being an integrated web application combining mind mapping, time tracking, collaboration, and roadmap functionality. With this tool, you can supplement learning resources like Obsidian and roadmap.sh, improving learning workflows. 

Key Features (TLDR)
Well-integrated mind map/road map/time tracking software that more accurately portrays topic complexity and estimated effort in one place
Developer-focused, ability to link projects
Multiplatform Application (Windows, Mac, Linux, Mobile)
Collaborative and multi-user capability (like if you could do a mindmap version of Google Docs' collaborative workspace)
Ability to export and import saved files into a database for servers or a personal web application
Open source and easy self-hosting, easy to attach to websites.
(Optional Backend feature) real-time project and mindmap timeline to track progress
Can set goals and milestones in each node
(Stretch: AI integration that improves map creation process)
